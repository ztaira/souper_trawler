<p>  I do consider writing style, ethics, grammar, and spelling in
  grading reports. 
  As an 
engineer, I spend a lot of my time writing, and I believe that it is
an important skill.  Furthermore I have found that when students
do not express their thoughts clearly, it is often because their
thoughts are not clear to them.  Here are some random thoughts I have
had about reports over the years.  The list is not comprehensive.
<\br>

First, here is a link to a paper that you can use as a guide.

<h4> SOME STYLE ISSUES  </h4>
 
<p> - Use section headings.  You may want to use a numbering scheme
  like Chapter 1, Section 1.1, Subsection 1.1.1, etc.  In a long
  document, I like to end the introduction with a roadmap of the rest
  of the document: "Section 2 describes ... ", etc.    </p>
 
<p> - Give figures and tables numbers and titles, and refer to them by
number in the text.  Capitalize the words figure, table, section, and
the like, when they are followed by a number.  For example, say
"<font color="#009900">Figure 1, in the previous section, shows
...</font>"
</p> 

<p>
- Use an "equation editor" for your equations.  Major equations should
be shown on a separate line, possibly with a number near the
right-hand edge of the column.  Short or less significant equations
can be included within the text.  Mathematical
expressions, 
<font color="#009900"><i> f = m a</i></font>, should be in slanted type.
</p>

<p> Foreign words and their abbreviations, 
<font color="#009900"><i>etc</i></font>., should be in 
  slant type.  
</p>

<p>- Appearance matters.  Use a word processor, and lay things out
neatly.
  </p>
 
<p> 
- In matlab, use thicker lines and larger text in your figures.  Many
other software packages also have very thin lines and small fonts as
defaults.  Change them.  Don't use any font smaller than 8 points,
even for subscripts and superscripts.  If you are going to reduce the
size of the figure for inclusion in the text, make sure that the fonts
will reduce to something greater than 8 points, and the lines to
something greater than one point.
</p> 
 
<p> -<b> <font color="#ffff00">Informal expressions</font></b> in technical
writing are usually <b><font color="#ff0000">uncool</font>.</b>  </p>
 
<p> - <b><font color="#ffff00">Use</font></b> parallel constructions in lists.
 </p>
 
<p> - Never have one item in a sublist  </p>
 
<p> - Active voice and first person <b><font color="#009900">will be accepted</font></b>
by this instructor, but not by everyone in engineering.  &#8220;Mistakes were made.&#8221;
 </p>
 
<p> - <b><font color="#ff0000">You</font></b> shouldn&#8217;t use the second person.
 </p>
 
<p> - Use a spell checker to <b><font color="#ff0000">ovoid stuped
misteaks</font></b>.
 </p>
 
<p> - Use a grammar checker.  It will lead to a very uniform and
boring, but correct style.  At least if you deviate from what they
allow, you will be aware that you are doing so. Sometimes a grammer
checker will find sentences <b><font color="#ff0000"> were </font></b>
you have spelling errors that will pass the spelling checker.
 
<p> - If you are not fluent in English, ask a native speaker to review your
 work.  Even a person not familiar with the subject can help you with your 
grammar.
</p>
 
<h4> WEBSITES AS SOURCES  </h4>
 
<p> - Use the web to...  </p>
 
<p>  -- Learn about a new field  </p>
 
<p>  -- Find out who is working in the field  </p>
 
<p>  -- Get pointers to the archival literature  </p>
 
<p> - Do not use web pages as citations  </p>
 
<p>  -- They are transient  </p>
 
<p>  -- They are not refereed  </p>
 
<p> - Catalog information for pricing, etc. is an exception if you include 
date information, etc.    </p>

<p> - NOTE: Many journals make the full articles available online, and
there are electronic journals such as Optics Express that are
exclusively online.  These are acceptable, because they are refereed,
archival journals.  The fact that you read them online rather than in
print does not detract from their quality, or their suitability as
references. </p>

<p> -- If you use these, cite the journal in the usual way, rather
than the web site from which you obtained it. </p>

<p> -- The University pays for some subscriptions, and the material is
available from any IP in the University, but not from outside.  If you
find one of these while on campus, remember that you may not be able to
access it from home.  Print a copy while you are on campus. </p>

<h4> SOME GRAMMAR ISSUES  </h4>

<p> - A preposition is a terrible part of speech to end a sentence <font
 color="#ff0000"><b>with</b>.</font>  "This is a situation up
 with which I will not put." [Winston Churchill]  </p> 
 
<p> - <b><font color="#ff0000">And</font> </b>starting with a conjunction
isn&#8217;t much better.  </p>

<p> - I don't like to <font color="#ff0000"><b> ever</b> </font> see a
split infinitive.  However, there is some disagreement on this among
  good grammarians.
 
<p> - <font color="#ff0000"><b>Another thing.  Little short phrases.  Not
quite sentences.  Not good.   Unless you are Jonathan Franzen</b>.</font>
  </p>

Sometimes <font color="#ff0000"><b>a student</b></font> 
will ignore number agreement
in <font color="#ff0000"><b>their</b></font> paper to 
avoid sexist pronouns.  There are other ways to handle this.  Rewrite
the sentence (best), alternate pronouns (not bad), or even use the
dreaded "s/he" (not great but acceptable, at least to me). 

<h4> SOME ETHICAL ISSUES  </h4>
 
<p> - If you borrow a figure, cite the source.  </p>
 
<p> - Reference anyone who contributes to your idea.  </p>
 
<p> - Paraphrasing is not the same thing as expressing your own thoughts.
 Reading someone's work and repeating it with bad grammar is still plagiarism.
